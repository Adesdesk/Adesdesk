### I am Adeola, a full-stack Javascript and Solidity Developer with extensive experience conceptualizing and developing full-stack web applications. Solving real-life problems using creatively written programming instructions is my delight. I am adept at various stages of the life cycle of web2 and web3 development including design, coding/programming, debugging, and maintenance. With a good number of full-stack decentralized and centralized applications to my credit, I look forward to contributing to the "birth" of more user-friendly, logic provoking, innovative solutions that sustainably improve human standards of living.

### Think about an adaptable team player with fast learning capacity, great organizational skills, and an eye for details, and my name pops up to fill that gap!
